## Task Manager

This project is a RESTful API for managing tasks, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on tasks. The backend is designed to follow RESTful principles, with features like filtering, sorting, and pagination.


# Features

  - Create new tasks with fields like title, description, status, priority, and due date.
  - Retrieve all tasks with options for filtering, sorting, and pagination.
  - Update task details, including changing task status.
  - Delete tasks (soft delete functionality optional).
  - Error handling for invalid inputs and API misuse.
  - Scalable, modular codebase.


# Technologies Used

  - Node.js: Server-side runtime environment.
  - Express.js: Web framework for building APIs.
  - MongoDB: NoSQL database for data persistence.
  - Mongoose: ODM for MongoDB for schema definitions and database interaction.
  - dotenv: For managing environment variables.
  - Joi/express-validator: For input validation.
